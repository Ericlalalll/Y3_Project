\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proved the two kinds of definition of reconstruction is equivalent for our purpose.
    \item Identified a realistic setting, partial seed set
    \item Proposed a greedy recovery algorithm for the partial seed set setting that perform strictly better than the random guess when $0<$ SNR $\leq1$ for both $k=2$ and $k=5$
    \item fast the greedy recovery algorithm in sparse graph
    \item improved the effective of the greedy recovery algorithm for dense graph.
    \item provided a mathematical analysis for the effectiveness of this algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the analysis: apply some more advanced mathematical and probabilistic tool to loose the constraint of $\Re_v$
    \item more clever heuristic
    \item  choose the part of assignment from spec which we are more confident
\end{itemize}
