\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Michael Gale, for his advice throughout this project and for shaping its
direction from the beginning. His feedback has always been comprehensive and insightful, and his dedication to
both teaching and supervision is clear to me.

Next, I wish to thank my former colleagues at MWR InfoSecurity. In particular: Kostas Lintovois, my mentor during
my time at MWR, taught me a great deal about practical security assurance work and cemented my knowledge of some of the
motivating vulnerabilities we discuss in this report. Donato Capitella and James Coote were a pleasure to work with
throughout the course of our project creating a platform for security-focussed training ``labs''--a project which
greatly improved my knowledge of software engineering.
And finally, thanks to the various consultants I worked with in the office and on-site: Mohit, James, Dennis, Alex, Amar,
Connor and many others.

Within Warwick, I am grateful to Mat Mannion and the teams within IT Services for their support of
my security work and exposing me to a range of new programming languages and technologies.

Whilst often overlooked, formatting is an essential part of any report, and I must gratefully acknowledge I have
received from the TeX.SX community and \LaTeX{} package maintainers who have answered my numerous questions.

Lastly, sincere thanks are due to my friends and family for their support during the year.\cite{example}
