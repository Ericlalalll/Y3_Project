\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Charilaos Efthymiou, without whom this project would not have been possible. I had never even heard of this topic at the beginning; it was Charis who guided me through this journey. Our weekly meetings, where he distilled relevant knowledge, answered my queries, and pointed out some of my more naive ideas, significantly reduced my learning curve and spared me many potential missteps. Furthermore, his guidance sparked my interest in statistical physics. Beyond academics, Charis also shared his personal experiences to help me navigate various life challenges throughout this academic year, which I found immensely helpful.
